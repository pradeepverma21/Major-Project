# Medicine Recommendation System

## Overview
The Medicine Recommendation System is a comprehensive solution designed to assist users in identifying potential diseases based on symptoms, and recommending appropriate medicines, workout plans, diet plans, and medication. This project integrates machine learning models and healthcare data to provide an intelligent and user-friendly platform for medical guidance.

## Features
- **Disease Prediction**: Predicts diseases based on user input symptoms.
- **Medicine Recommendations**: Suggests medicines for the identified diseases.
- **Workout Plans**: Recommends workout plans tailored to the disease.
- **Diet Plans**: Provides diet plans suitable for the disease or condition.
- **Detailed Descriptions**: Offers detailed information about the predicted diseases.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: Flask (for the web application)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Database**: SQLite/MySQL (for storing disease, medicine, and user data)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/medicine-recommendation-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd medicine-recommendation-system
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
5. Open the application in your browser:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

## How It Works
1. **User Input**: Users input their symptoms via the web interface.
2. **Disease Prediction**: The system processes the input and predicts potential diseases using the trained machine learning model.
3. **Recommendations**: Based on the predicted disease, the system provides:
   - Medicine suggestions
   - Diet plans
   - Workout plans
   - Detailed disease information

## Project Structure
- **/templates**: HTML templates for the web interface
- **/static**: CSS and JavaScript files
- **/models**: Pre-trained machine learning models
- **/data**: Dataset files for training and testing
- **app.py**: Flask application script
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies

## Dataset
The system is trained on a curated healthcare dataset containing symptoms, diseases, medicines, and related recommendations. The dataset ensures accurate and relevant predictions.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with external APIs for real-time medicine availability.
- Adding multilingual support for a global audience.
- Expanding the database to include more diseases and medicines.
- Incorporating user feedback to refine recommendations.
